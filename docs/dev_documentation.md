# ChatProxy Feature

The virtual API feature, as implemented in the provided Kotlin code, allows for the dynamic creation of API endpoints
that leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models to process and respond to requests. This feature is particularly
useful for simulating or proxying APIs with complex logic without the need for explicit programming for each endpoint.
Below is a detailed documentation of the key components and functionalities of the virtual API feature.

### Overview

The virtual API feature is built around several Kotlin classes, primarily `ChatProxy`, `GPTProxyBase`,
and `ValidatedObject`, which work together to dynamically generate responses to API requests by communicating with
OpenAI's GPT models. The system is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy customization of the model used, the
temperature (creativity) of the responses, and the validation of the generated responses.

### Key Components

#### `ChatProxy`

- **Purpose**: `ChatProxy` is a specialized proxy that handles chat-based interactions with an OpenAI GPT model. It is
  designed to format requests and responses in a way that is suitable for chat-based communication.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Dynamic Request Handling**: It can dynamically construct chat requests based on method calls to the proxy,
      including handling of various input arguments and formatting them appropriately.
    - **Response Processing**: It processes the responses from the GPT model, trimming unnecessary prefixes and
      suffixes, and ensuring the response is in the expected format.
    - **Metrics Collection**: It collects various metrics related to the requests and responses, such as input and
      output lengths, which can be useful for monitoring and debugging.

#### `GPTProxyBase`

- **Purpose**: Serves as the base class for creating proxies that interact with GPT models. It provides the core
  functionality for making requests to the models and processing their responses.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Proxy Creation**: It uses Kotlin's `Proxy` mechanism to dynamically create API endpoints based on the provided
      interface.
    - **Response Validation**: It supports validation of the generated responses to ensure they meet certain criteria,
      which can be customized by implementing the `ValidatedObject` interface.
    - **Retry Logic**: It implements retry logic with temperature adjustment to encourage the model to generate
      different responses on subsequent attempts if the initial response is not satisfactory.

#### `ValidatedObject`

- **Purpose**: Provides a mechanism for validating the objects generated by the GPT model to ensure they meet certain
  criteria.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Custom Validation**: Classes implementing this interface can define custom validation logic by overriding
      the `validate` method.

### How It Works

1. **Proxy Creation**: An instance of `ChatProxy` is created, specifying the class of the API interface, the OpenAI
   client, and other configuration options.
2. **API Call Simulation**: When a method on the proxy instance is called, it constructs a `ChatRequest` based on the
   method name, arguments, and additional metadata.
3. **Request Processing**: The request is sent to the OpenAI GPT model, which generates a response based on the input.
4. **Response Handling**: The response from the model is processed by `ChatProxy`, trimming unnecessary parts and
   converting it into the expected format.
5. **Validation (Optional)**: If the response object implements `ValidatedObject`, its `validate` method is called to
   ensure the response meets the defined criteria.

### Usage Example

```kotlin
val apiClient = OpenAIClient(apiKey = "your_api_key")
val chatProxy = ChatProxy(
    clazz = YourApiInterface::class.java,
    api = apiClient,
    model = ChatModels.Gpt3_5Turbo,
    temperature = 0.5
)

val yourApi = chatProxy.create()
val response = yourApi.yourMethod(yourArguments)
```

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the virtual API feature, detailing its key components,
functionalities, and usage.

# Prompt Optimization Developer Documentation

The Prompt Optimization feature is designed to enhance the quality of prompts used in chat models by employing genetic
algorithms. This document provides an overview of the implementation, usage, and customization options available for
developers integrating or modifying prompt optimization in their applications.

## Overview

Prompt Optimization leverages genetic algorithms to iteratively improve prompts based on their performance against
specified criteria or test cases. This process involves evaluating a population of prompts, selecting the best
performers, and using them to generate a new population through mutation and recombination.

## Key Components

### PromptOptimization Class

The `PromptOptimization` class is the core of the prompt optimization feature. It manages the optimization process,
including the generation of prompt populations, evaluation against test cases, and the application of genetic
operations.

#### Constructor Parameters

- `api`: An instance of `OpenAIClient` used to interact with the OpenAI API.
- `model`: The `ChatModels` instance specifying the chat model to be used for testing prompts.
- `mutationRate`: The probability of mutation occurring during the generation of new prompts.
- `mutationTypes`: A map defining the types of mutations available and their relative probabilities.

#### Methods

- `runGeneticGenerations`: Executes the optimization process for a specified number of generations.
- `regenerate`: Generates a new population of prompts from the given progenitors.
- `recombine`: Combines two prompts into a new prompt, potentially followed by a mutation.
- `mutate`: Applies a mutation to a given prompt.
- `getMutationDirective`: Randomly selects a mutation type based on the configured probabilities.
- `evaluate`: Evaluates the performance of a system prompt against a test case.
- `run`: Executes a test case using the given system prompt.

### TestCase and Turn Classes

- `TestCase`: Represents a set of interactions (turns) and the number of retries allowed for each turn.
- `Turn`: Represents a single interaction, including the user's message and expected responses.

## Usage

To use the `PromptOptimization` feature, follow these steps:

1. **Instantiate `PromptOptimization`**:
   Create an instance of `PromptOptimization` with the required `OpenAIClient`, `ChatModels`, and optional mutation
   parameters.

2. **Define Test Cases**:
   Create instances of `TestCase`, each containing multiple `Turn` instances that define the interactions and expected
   responses.

3. **Run Optimization**:
   Call the `runGeneticGenerations` method with your initial prompts, test cases, and other parameters to start the
   optimization process.

### Example

```kotlin
val apiClient = OpenAIClient("your_api_key")
val promptOptimization = PromptOptimization(api = apiClient, model = OpenAIModels.GPT3_5Turbo)

val testCases = listOf(
    TestCase(
        turns = listOf(
            Turn("Hello, how are you?", listOf(Expectation.ContainsMatch("I'm good, thank you!")))
        )
    )
)

val optimizedPrompts = promptOptimization.runGeneticGenerations(
    systemPrompts = listOf("Initial prompt"),
    testCases = testCases,
    generations = 5
)

println("Optimized Prompts: $optimizedPrompts")
```

## Customization

Developers can customize the optimization process by adjusting the mutation rate, defining custom mutation types, and
specifying different evaluation criteria within the `TestCase` and `Turn` instances.

### Mutation Types

Custom mutation types can be defined by extending the `mutationTypes` map in the `PromptOptimization` constructor. Each
mutation type should correspond to a specific strategy for altering prompts.

### Evaluation Criteria

The performance of prompts can be evaluated against custom criteria by implementing subclasses of `Expectation` and
using them within `Turn` instances. This allows for flexible and domain-specific optimization of prompts.

## Conclusion

The Prompt Optimization feature provides a powerful tool for improving the effectiveness of prompts used in chat models.
By leveraging genetic algorithms, developers can systematically explore the space of possible prompts and converge on
optimal solutions based on specified performance criteria.

# API.kt

for interacting with OpenAI's services or similar AI technologies. This class serves as an open base class, potentially
offering a framework for building specific API interactions, authentication mechanisms, and data processing methods.

### Class Declaration

```java
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai;

open class API{
        // Class implementation goes here
        }
```

#### Key Features:

- **Open Class**: In Kotlin, the `open` keyword indicates that the class is open for inheritance, allowing other classes
  to inherit from `API`. This is crucial for extending the functionality of the `API` class without modifying its source
  code.
- **Package Membership**: The class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai` package, suggesting it is tailored for
  operations related to OpenAI or similar AI technologies.

### Usage

To utilize the `API` class, developers should extend it to create more specific API interaction classes. This approach
enables the encapsulation of common functionalities within the `API` class, while specific implementations can be
tailored in subclasses.

#### Example:

```java
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.custom;

import com.simiacryptus.jopenai.API;

public class CustomAPI extends API {
    // Implement specific API functionalities here
}
```

In this example, `CustomAPI` extends the `API` class, allowing it to inherit any base functionality defined in `API` and
add or override functionalities specific to `CustomAPI`.

### Extending the API Class

When extending the `API` class, consider the following:

- **Authentication**: Implement authentication mechanisms required for secure API calls.
- **Data Processing**: Define methods for processing input and output data to and from the API.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage API request failures gracefully.

### Conclusion

The `API` class in the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai` package provides a foundational framework for interacting with
OpenAI's services or similar technologies. By designing the class to be open for extension, it offers flexibility and
encourages the development of customized API interaction layers suited to specific needs.

# audio\AudioRecorder.kt

## AudioRecorder Class Documentation

The `AudioRecorder` class in the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.audio` package is designed to facilitate audio recording in
Java applications. It captures audio from the microphone, processes it into packets of a specified duration, and stores
these packets in a provided buffer for further processing or analysis.

### Dependencies

- Apache Commons IO
- SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)
- Java Sound API (`javax.sound.sampled`)

### Class Overview

#### Constructor Parameters

- `audioBuffer`: A `Deque<ByteArray>` that stores the audio packets recorded from the microphone.
- `secondsPerPacket`: A `Double` value representing the duration of each audio packet in seconds.
- `continueFn`: A lambda function `() -> Boolean` that dictates whether the recording should continue. The recording
  loop checks this function to decide if it should keep recording or stop.

#### Properties

- `packetLength`: An `Int` calculated based on the audio format's frame rate, frame size, and the specified duration for
  each packet (`secondsPerPacket`). It represents the size of each audio packet in bytes.

#### Methods

- `run()`: Starts the audio recording process. It captures audio from the microphone, divides it into packets of the
  specified duration, and stores these packets in the `audioBuffer`. The recording continues as long as `continueFn`
  returns `true`.

#### Companion Object

##### Properties

- `log`: A logger instance for logging information and errors.
- `audioFormat`: The audio format used for recording. It is set to a sample rate of 16000 Hz, 16 bits per sample, mono,
  with PCM encoding.

##### Methods

- `openMic()`: Opens and starts the target data line (microphone) for capturing audio. It returns a `TargetDataLine`
  instance configured with the specified `audioFormat`.

### Usage Example

```kotlin
import java.util.ArrayDeque

fun main() {
    val audioBuffer = ArrayDeque<ByteArray>()
    val secondsPerPacket = 0.5 // 500 milliseconds per packet
    val continueRecording = { true } // Replace with actual logic to stop recording

    val audioRecorder = AudioRecorder(audioBuffer, secondsPerPacket, continueRecording)
    audioRecorder.run()
}
```

This example initializes an `AudioRecorder` with a half-second packet duration and starts the recording process.
The `continueRecording` lambda should be replaced with actual logic to stop recording, such as a timeout or user input.

### Notes

- Ensure that your application has the necessary permissions to access the microphone.
- The `audioBuffer` should be consumed by another thread or process to avoid filling up and potentially causing memory
  issues.
- The recording process runs in the calling thread. Consider running `audioRecorder.run()` in a separate thread if your
  application requires concurrent processing.

# audio\LoudnessWindowBuffer.kt

## LoudnessWindowBuffer Class Documentation

The `LoudnessWindowBuffer` class is an abstract class designed to manage and process audio data in the form of byte
arrays. It is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.audio` package. This class is responsible for reading audio packets
from an input buffer, processing them, and then optionally writing the processed audio data to an output buffer. The
decision to write to the output buffer is determined by the implementation of the `shouldOutput` abstract method.

### Class Structure

#### Properties

- `inputBuffer: Deque<ByteArray>`: A double-ended queue holding the input byte arrays representing audio data.
- `outputBuffer: Deque<ByteArray>`: A double-ended queue for storing processed audio data in byte array format.
- `continueFn: () -> Boolean`: A function that determines whether the processing loop should continue running.
- `outputPacketBuffer: ArrayList<AudioPacket>`: A list that temporarily holds audio packets before they are processed
  and potentially added to the output buffer.
- `recentPacketBuffer: ArrayList<AudioPacket>`: A list used to store a recent history of audio packets for processing
  purposes. The size of this buffer is controlled by `packetLookback`.
- `packetLookback: Int`: The number of recent packets to retain in the `recentPacketBuffer`.

#### Constructor

The constructor takes three parameters: `inputBuffer`, `outputBuffer`, and `continueFn`, initializing the respective
properties of the class.

#### Methods

- `run()`: The main function of the class that continuously polls the `inputBuffer` for new audio data, processes it,
  and conditionally adds it to the `outputBuffer` based on the `shouldOutput` method's result.
- `shouldOutput(): Boolean`: An abstract method that subclasses must implement. It determines whether the processed
  audio data should be written to the `outputBuffer`.

#### Companion Object

- `log`: A logger instance for logging messages. It is associated with the `LoudnessWindowBuffer` class.

### Usage

To use the `LoudnessWindowBuffer` class, one must extend it and provide an implementation for the `shouldOutput` method.
This method should contain the logic to decide when the processed audio data is ready to be written to
the `outputBuffer`.

#### Example

```kotlin
class MyLoudnessBuffer(
    inputBuffer: Deque<ByteArray>,
    outputBuffer: Deque<ByteArray>,
    continueFn: () -> Boolean
) : LoudnessWindowBuffer(inputBuffer, outputBuffer, continueFn) {

    override fun shouldOutput(): Boolean {
        // Implement logic to determine when to output processed data
        return true // Example condition
    }
}

```

In this example, `MyLoudnessBuffer` extends `LoudnessWindowBuffer` and provides an implementation for the `shouldOutput`
method. The logic within `shouldOutput` should be replaced with actual conditions that suit the application's needs.

### Conclusion

The `LoudnessWindowBuffer` class provides a flexible framework for processing audio data. By extending this class and
implementing the `shouldOutput` method, developers can create customized audio processing pipelines that fit their
specific requirements.

# audio\TranscriptionProcessor.kt

## TranscriptionProcessor Class Documentation

The `TranscriptionProcessor` class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.audio` package and is designed to handle the
transcription of audio data using the OpenAI API. This class provides a framework for continuously processing audio
data, converting it into text, and performing actions based on the transcribed text.

### Overview

The `TranscriptionProcessor` class is an open class that can be extended if needed. It is initialized with a set of
parameters that define its behavior, including the OpenAI client for transcription, an audio buffer for storing audio
data, a continuation condition, an initial prompt, and a callback function for handling the transcribed text.

### Constructor Parameters

- `client: OpenAIClient`: An instance of the `OpenAIClient` class, used to interact with the OpenAI API for audio
  transcription.
- `audioBuffer: Deque<ByteArray>`: A double-ended queue that holds the audio data to be transcribed. The audio data is
  expected to be in the form of byte arrays.
- `continueFn: () -> Boolean`: A lambda function that returns a Boolean value. The transcription process continues as
  long as this function returns `true` or there is audio data left in the buffer.
- `prompt: String`: An optional initial prompt that can be used to provide context for the transcription. This can be
  useful for guiding the transcription process or for continuing from a previous transcription.
- `onText: (String) -> Unit`: A callback function that is invoked with the transcribed text. This allows the caller to
  define custom behavior for handling the transcribed text, such as displaying it to the user or storing it for further
  processing.

### Methods

#### run()

The `run` method starts the transcription process and continues until the `continueFn` returns `false` and the audio
buffer is empty. It processes audio data from the buffer, transcribes it using the OpenAI API, and invokes the `onText`
callback with the resulting text.

The method works as follows:

1. It enters a loop that continues as long as `continueFn` returns `true` or there is audio data in the buffer.
2. It polls the audio buffer for audio data. If no data is available, it sleeps for 1 millisecond and then retries.
3. If audio data is available, it transcribes the data using the `client.transcription` method, optionally prepending
   the current `prompt` to the transcription request.
4. It updates the `prompt` with the last 32 words of the combined prompt and transcribed text to maintain context for
   subsequent transcriptions.
5. It invokes the `onText` callback with the transcribed text.

### Usage Example

```kotlin
val openAIClient = OpenAIClient(/* configuration */)
val audioBuffer: Deque<ByteArray> = LinkedList()
val continueFn = { /* logic to continue or stop */ }
val onText: (String) -> Unit = { text -> println(text) }

val transcriptionProcessor = TranscriptionProcessor(
    client = openAIClient,
    audioBuffer = audioBuffer,
    continueFn = continueFn,
    prompt = "",
    onText = onText
)

// Start the transcription process
transcriptionProcessor.run()
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize and use the `TranscriptionProcessor` class to transcribe audio data.
The `openAIClient` should be configured with the necessary credentials and settings for interacting with the OpenAI API.
The `audioBuffer` should be populated with audio data to be transcribed. The `continueFn` should define the condition
for continuing the transcription process. The `onText` callback allows for custom handling of the transcribed text.

# describe\AbbrevWhitelistYamlDescriber.kt

## AbbrevWhitelistYamlDescriber Class Documentation

The `AbbrevWhitelistYamlDescriber` class extends the functionality of `YamlDescriber` to provide a mechanism for
determining whether a given Java `Type` should be abbreviated in YAML descriptions, based on a whitelist of type name
prefixes. This class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.describe` package.

### Usage

This class is designed for use in scenarios where YAML descriptions of Java types are generated, and there is a need to
selectively abbreviate certain types based on their names. By providing a list of type name prefixes, users can control
which types are considered for abbreviation.

### Constructor

The class constructor takes a variable number of `String` arguments, each representing a prefix of type names that are
eligible for abbreviation.

```java
AbbrevWhitelistYamlDescriber(String... abbreviated)
```

#### Parameters:

- `abbreviated`: A vararg array of `String` objects, each representing a prefix for type names that should be considered
  for abbreviation.

### Methods

#### isAbbreviated

Determines whether the specified `Type` should be abbreviated in the YAML description.

```java

@Override
public boolean isAbbreviated(Type self)
```

##### Parameters:

- `self`: The `Type` object to check for abbreviation eligibility.

##### Returns:

- `boolean`: Returns `true` if the type should be abbreviated, `false` otherwise.

##### Logic:

1. **Primitive Types**: If the type is a primitive type (as defined in `TypeDescriber.primitives`), it is not
   abbreviated.
2. **List Types**: If the type is a `ParameterizedType` representing a `List`, the method recursively checks if the
   list's element type should be abbreviated.
3. **Map Types**: If the type is a `ParameterizedType` representing a `Map`, the method recursively checks if both the
   key and value types should be abbreviated.
4. **Array Types**: If the type is an array, the method recursively checks if the component type should be abbreviated.
5. **Whitelist Check**: If the type's name starts with any of the prefixes provided in the `abbreviated` parameter of
   the constructor, it is considered for abbreviation unless overridden by the superclass's `isAbbreviated` method.

### Example Usage

```java
AbbrevWhitelistYamlDescriber describer = new AbbrevWhitelistYamlDescriber("com.myapp.models", "org.example.types");
Type myType = ...; // Obtain a Type instance
boolean shouldAbbreviate = describer.isAbbreviated(myType);
```

In this example, `myType` will be checked against the provided prefixes (`"com.myapp.models"`, `"org.example.types"`) to
determine if it should be abbreviated in the YAML description.

### Dependencies

- `YamlDescriber`: The superclass providing the basic YAML description functionality.
- Java Reflection API: Used for inspecting types (`java.lang.reflect.Type`, `java.lang.reflect.ParameterizedType`,
  etc.).

### Package

This class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.describe` package, which contains utilities for describing Java
types in YAML format, particularly in the context of OpenAI applications.

# describe\Description.kt

### Overview

The `Description` annotation is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.describe` package. It is designed to provide a way
to attach descriptive metadata to various elements within your code, such as classes, methods, or fields. This metadata
can then be utilized for documentation, code analysis, or by tools that process annotations at runtime or during the
build process.

### Annotation Definition

```kotlin
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.describe

@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Description(val value: String)
```

#### Attributes

- `value`: A `String` that holds the descriptive text. This is the only attribute of the `Description` annotation, and
  it is mandatory.

#### Retention Policy

- `@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)`: This annotation specifies that the `Description` annotation is to be
  retained at runtime. This means that it can be accessed through reflection during the execution of your program. This
  is crucial for scenarios where the description needs to be retrieved dynamically, such as in documentation generation
  tools or when performing runtime analysis.

### Usage

The `Description` annotation can be applied to various program elements. Here are a few examples:

#### Annotating a Class

```kotlin
@Description("This class represents a user in the system.")
class User {
    // Class implementation
}
```

#### Annotating a Method

```kotlin
class User {

    @Description("This method returns the user's full name.")
    fun getFullName(): String {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

#### Annotating a Field

```kotlin
class User {

    @Description("The user's first name.")
    var firstName: String = ""

    @Description("The user's last name.")
    var lastName: String = ""
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Be consistent in how and where you apply the `Description` annotation. This helps in maintaining a
  uniform approach to documentation within your codebase.
- **Clarity and Conciseness**: The description should be clear and concise, providing enough information to understand
  the purpose of the annotated element without being overly verbose.
- **Maintenance**: Keep the descriptions up to date. As your code evolves, make sure to revisit and revise the
  descriptions to reflect any changes in behavior or purpose.

### Conclusion

The `Description` annotation provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for adding descriptive metadata to your code
elements. By leveraging this annotation, developers can improve the readability and maintainability of their code,
facilitate documentation generation, and support various runtime analysis and processing tasks.

This class is designed to facilitate the generation of JSON descriptions for classes, primarily focusing on those within
specified whitelisted packages.

### Features

- **Whitelist Filtering**: Only classes within predefined whitelisted packages are described. This is to ensure that
  only relevant classes are processed, enhancing security and performance.
- **Recursion Prevention**: To avoid infinite loops during description generation, especially with self-referencing
  types, the class implements checks to prevent recursion beyond a certain depth.
- **Visibility Filtering**: Only public properties and methods are included in the descriptions, adhering to the
  principle of least privilege and focusing on the API's public interface.
- **Method Blacklisting**: Certain common methods (e.g., `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`) are excluded from the
  descriptions to reduce noise and focus on the more relevant aspects of the class's functionality.
- **Support for Kotlin**: Special handling for Kotlin classes, leveraging Kotlin reflection to access properties and
  their visibility, as well as handling Kotlin-specific annotations.

### Usage

To use `JsonDescriber`, instantiate it with an optional whitelist of package names. Then, call the `describe` method
with the class you wish to describe, along with the maximum stack depth for recursion and a set of already described
types to prevent recursion.

#### Example

```kotlin
val describer = JsonDescriber()
val jsonDescription = describer.describe(MyClass::class.java, 10, mutableSetOf())
println(jsonDescription)
```

### Methods

#### describe(Class<in Nothing>, Int, MutableSet<String>): String

Generates a JSON description of the specified class. It filters based on the whitelist and handles recursion
appropriately. The method differentiates between Kotlin and Java classes to accurately describe their properties and
methods.

#### describe(Method, Class<*>, Int): String

Generates a JSON description for a given method, including its return type and, if available, a description annotation.
This method supports both Java and Kotlin methods.

### Configuration

- **Whitelist**: The set of package names to be considered for description. Classes outside these packages will not be
  described.
- **Markup Language**: Always returns `"json"` as this describer generates JSON output.

utilizes reflection to analyze and describe types.

### Overview

The `TypeDescriber` class serves as a base for implementing specific describers that can output descriptions in various
markup languages. It provides abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses to generate descriptions for
classes and methods. Additionally, it offers utility methods to determine if a type should be abbreviated in the
description based on its nature or namespace.

### Key Features

- **Markup Language Support**: Subclasses must specify the markup language used for the descriptions through
  the `markupLanguage` abstract property.
- **Method Filtering**: The `methodBlacklist` abstract property allows subclasses to specify a set of method names to be
  excluded from the description.
- **Method Coverage**: The `coverMethods` boolean property determines whether methods of a class should be included in
  its description.
- **Type Description**: Abstract methods `describe` are provided for generating descriptions of classes and methods.
- **Abbreviation Logic**: An open method `isAbbreviated` is provided to determine if a type's description should be
  abbreviated based on its characteristics.

### Properties

- `abstract val markupLanguage: String`: Specifies the markup language used for descriptions.
- `abstract val methodBlacklist: Set<String>`: Defines a set of method names to exclude from descriptions.
- `var coverMethods: Boolean`: Determines whether to include method descriptions in class descriptions.

### Methods

#### Abstract Methods

- `abstract fun describe(rawType: Class<in Nothing>, stackMax: Int = 10, describedTypes: MutableSet<String> = mutableSetOf()): String`:
  Generates a description for a given class.
- `abstract fun describe(self: Method, clazz: Class<*>? = null, stackMax: Int = 5): String`: Generates a description for
  a given method.

#### Open Methods

- `open fun isAbbreviated(self: Type): Boolean`: Determines if the description of a type should be abbreviated. This
  decision is based on the type's name, whether it is a primitive, part of a collection, an array, or belongs to certain
  namespaces like `java.`, `kotlin.`, etc.

### Companion Object

- `val primitives: Set<String>`: A set of strings representing primitive types and common classes. This is used in the
  abbreviation logic to identify simple types that do not require abbreviation.

### Usage

To use the `TypeDescriber` class, one must extend it and implement the abstract properties and methods. The subclass
should provide the logic for generating descriptions in the specified markup language and may override
the `isAbbreviated` method if different abbreviation logic is required.

Example:

```kotlin
class HTMLTypeDescriber : TypeDescriber() {
    override val markupLanguage = "HTML"
    override val methodBlacklist = setOf("toString", "hashCode")

    override fun describe(rawType: Class<in Nothing>, stackMax: Int, describedTypes: MutableSet<String>): String {
        // Implementation for describing a class in HTML
    }

    override fun describe(self: Method, clazz: Class<*>?, stackMax: Int): String {
        // Implementation for describing a method in HTML
    }
}
```

This class provides a flexible foundation for creating detailed and structured descriptions of Java types, which can be
useful for documentation, analysis, or code generation tools.

# exceptions\InvalidValueException.kt

## InvalidValueException Documentation

### Overview

`InvalidValueException` is a custom exception class in the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions` package. It
extends `AIServiceException`, indicating that it is specifically designed for use within an AI service context. This
exception is thrown to indicate that an invalid value has been encountered for a given field within the service.

### Class Definition

```kotlin
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions

class InvalidValueException(field: String?, value: String?) : AIServiceException("Invalid value: $field = $value")
```

### Constructor Parameters

- `field: String?`: The name of the field that received the invalid value. This parameter is nullable, allowing for
  cases where the field might not be known or applicable.
- `value: String?`: The invalid value that was assigned or passed to the field. Similar to the `field` parameter, this
  is also nullable to accommodate various scenarios, including the absence of a specific value.

### Usage

`InvalidValueException` is typically thrown when a validation check fails, indicating that a provided value does not
meet the expected criteria for a specific field. This could occur in various scenarios, such as user input validation,
data processing, or during configuration settings checks.

#### Example

Consider a scenario where you have a function that processes user input for an AI model's configuration setting, which
expects a positive integer value:

```kotlin
fun setModelComplexity(complexity: Int) {
    if (complexity <= 0) {
        throw InvalidValueException("complexity", complexity.toString())
    }
    // Proceed with setting the model complexity
}
```

In this example, if `setModelComplexity` is called with a non-positive integer, an `InvalidValueException` will be
thrown, indicating that the "complexity" field received an invalid value.

### Best Practices

- Use `InvalidValueException` to clearly communicate issues related to invalid values in specific fields, enhancing the
  debuggability of your AI service.
- Provide meaningful `field` and `value` information when throwing this exception to aid in identifying the source of
  the problem quickly.
- Catch `InvalidValueException` at appropriate levels in your application where you can handle the error gracefully,
  such as prompting the user for a valid input or logging the issue for further investigation.

### Conclusion

`InvalidValueException` serves as a specialized exception for signaling invalid values in specific fields within an AI
service context. By leveraging this exception class, developers can more effectively manage and respond to value-related
errors, ensuring the robustness and reliability of their AI applications.

import java.io.IOException
```

#### Description

`RequestOverloadException` is a custom exception class that extends `IOException`. It is designed to be thrown when a
specific model within the application is overloaded with requests. This exception helps in signaling to the caller that
the model cannot process any more requests at the moment due to overload. The class provides a default message
indicating the overload situation but also allows for custom messages to be specified.

#### Usage

This exception should be thrown in scenarios where a model or a service within the application is unable to handle
additional requests due to reaching its capacity or being overwhelmed by the current load. It aids in gracefully
handling overload situations by informing the caller of the overload condition, allowing for possible retry or back-off
logic to be implemented.

#### Constructor

The class provides a single constructor:

```kotlin
RequestOverloadException(message: String = "That model is currently overloaded with other requests.")
```

##### Parameters:

- `message: String` (optional): The message describing the exception. It defaults to "That model is currently overloaded
  with other requests." if no custom message is provided.

#### Inheritance

This class extends `java.io.IOException`, making it a checked exception in Kotlin. As such, it must be either caught or
declared in the method signature where it might be thrown.

#### Example Usage

Below is an example demonstrating how to throw and catch a `RequestOverloadException`:

```kotlin
fun processRequest() {
    try {
        // Simulate checking the load on a model
        val isOverloaded = true // This would typically be determined dynamically
        if (isOverloaded) {
            throw RequestOverloadException()
        }
        // Proceed with request processing
    } catch (e: RequestOverloadException) {
        println("Caught an overload exception: ${e.message}")
        // Implement retry logic, log the error, or notify the user as necessary
    }
}
```

#### Best Practices

- Use `RequestOverloadException` specifically for scenarios involving overload of models or services to maintain
  semantic clarity.
- Catch this exception at boundaries where you can meaningfully handle or report the overload situation.
- Consider implementing retry logic with exponential backoff when catching this exception to gracefully handle temporary
  overloads.

#### Conclusion

`RequestOverloadException` is a specialized exception class for handling overload situations in applications,
particularly when dealing with models or services that have a limit on how many requests they can process concurrently.
By extending `IOException`, it integrates well with existing error handling mechanisms and provides a clear pathway for
managing overload scenarios.

# exceptions\SafetyException.kt

### SafetyException Class Documentation

#### Package

`com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions`

#### Overview

The `SafetyException` class is a custom exception that extends the `AIServiceException`. It is specifically designed to
represent situations where a safety violation occurs within the context of AI services provided by the library. This
exception is thrown to indicate that an operation could not be completed due to safety concerns, ensuring that the
system adheres to predefined safety protocols.

#### Usage

The `SafetyException` is used within the AI service framework to signal that an action or request has been denied or
could not be processed due to it violating safety constraints. This could be in response to content that is deemed
inappropriate, dangerous, or in violation of certain ethical or operational guidelines.

#### Declaration

```kotlin
class SafetyException : AIServiceException("Safety violation")
```

#### Constructor

The `SafetyException` does not have a custom constructor and inherits its behavior from the `AIServiceException`. It
initializes the exception with a default message indicating a safety violation.

##### Parameters

- The constructor does not accept any parameters. It uses a fixed message `"Safety violation"` to indicate the nature of
  the exception.

#### Inheritance

- Inherits from `AIServiceException`.

#### Example Usage

Below is an example demonstrating how the `SafetyException` might be thrown in a method that checks for compliance with
safety guidelines before proceeding with an operation:

```kotlin
fun checkContentSafety(content: String) {
    if (!isContentSafe(content)) {
        throw SafetyException()
    }
    // Proceed with operation as content is safe
}

fun isContentSafe(content: String): Boolean {
    // Implementation of safety check
    // Returns true if content is safe, false otherwise
    return content.length < 100 // Example condition for simplicity
}
```

In this example, `checkContentSafety` is a function that evaluates whether a given piece of content is safe to process.
If the `isContentSafe` function determines that the content violates safety guidelines (in this simplistic example, if
the content length is 100 characters or more), the `SafetyException` is thrown, halting further processing of the
content.

#### Best Practices

- Use the `SafetyException` to clearly indicate safety violations in your AI service operations.
- Catch the `SafetyException` at appropriate levels in your application where you can safely handle or log the
  occurrence of such exceptions.
- Ensure that the use of `SafetyException` is consistent across your application to maintain clarity and predictability
  in error handling.

#### See Also

- `AIServiceException`: The parent class from which `SafetyException` inherits. Provides a general framework for
  exceptions related to AI services.

# models\OpenAIModel.kt

## OpenAIModel Interface Documentation

### Package

`com.simiacryptus.jopenai.models`

### Overview

The `OpenAIModel` interface is a fundamental component within the package, designed to establish a common structure for
representing models from OpenAI within the application. It serves as a contract that all specific OpenAI model
implementations must adhere to, ensuring a consistent approach to handling different models across the application.

### Interface Definition

```kotlin
interface OpenAIModel {
    val modelName: String
}
```

#### Properties

- `modelName`: A `String` property that holds the name of the OpenAI model. This property is essential for identifying
  the model and is used throughout the application to reference the specific implementation of the `OpenAIModel`
  interface.

### Implementation Guidelines

To implement the `OpenAIModel` interface, a class must provide an implementation for all abstract properties and methods
defined in the interface. Here is a basic example of how to implement the `OpenAIModel` interface:

```kotlin
class GPT3Model : OpenAIModel {
    override val modelName: String = "gpt-3"
}
```

In this example, `GPT3Model` is a concrete class that implements the `OpenAIModel` interface, providing a specific model
name (`"gpt-3"`). This approach allows for the easy addition of more models by defining new classes that implement
the `OpenAIModel` interface, each with its unique model name.

### Usage

The `OpenAIModel` interface and its implementations can be used throughout the application to abstract away the
specifics of different OpenAI models. This allows for more flexible and maintainable code, as changes to a specific
model implementation do not affect the rest of the application, provided the interface contract is maintained.

For example, a function that takes an `OpenAIModel` as a parameter can work with any model implementation, such
as `GPT3Model`, without needing to know the specifics of the model:

```kotlin
fun useModel(model: OpenAIModel) {
    println("Using model: ${model.modelName}")
}
```

This function can be called with any instance of `OpenAIModel`, demonstrating the flexibility provided by using
interfaces in Kotlin.

### Conclusion

The `OpenAIModel` interface plays a crucial role in the application's architecture, promoting a modular and extensible
approach to integrating OpenAI models. By adhering to this interface, the application can easily accommodate new models
and changes to existing models, facilitating future development and maintenance.

## OpenAITextModel Serialization and Deserialization

The `OpenAITextModel` class, along with its serializer `OpenAITextModelSerializer` and
deserializer `OpenAITextModelDeserializer`, facilitates the conversion of OpenAI text model data to and from JSON
format. This documentation provides an overview of these components, their functionalities, and how they are implemented
in the code.

### Overview

- **OpenAITextModel**: Represents a model for OpenAI's text-based services, including properties like `modelName`
  and `maxTokens`. It also includes a method `pricing` to calculate the cost based on usage.
- **OpenAITextModelSerializer**: A custom serializer for `OpenAITextModel` objects, converting them into a JSON string
  representation.
- **OpenAITextModelDeserializer**: A custom deserializer for `OpenAITextModel` objects, parsing JSON string
  representations back into `OpenAITextModel` instances.

### OpenAITextModel Class

#### Properties

- `modelName`: A `String` representing the name of the model.
- `maxTokens`: An `Int` indicating the maximum number of tokens the model can process.

#### Methods

- `pricing(usage: Usage)`: Calculates the pricing based on the provided `Usage` object. By default, it returns `0.0`.

### OpenAITextModelSerializer Class

This class extends `StdSerializer` from the Jackson library to provide custom serialization logic for `OpenAITextModel`
instances.

#### Serialization Logic

1. It first aggregates all model names from predefined
   enums (`ChatModels`, `CompletionModels`, `EmbeddingModels`, `EditModels`) into a single list.
2. It attempts to find the `OpenAITextModel` instance within this aggregated list by comparing the model's value.
3. If found, it serializes the corresponding key (model name) into JSON. If not found, it directly serializes
   the `modelName` property of the `OpenAITextModel`.

### OpenAITextModelDeserializer Class

This class extends `JsonDeserializer` from the Jackson library to provide custom deserialization logic
for `OpenAITextModel` instances.

#### Deserialization Logic

1. It reads the model name from the JSON input as a `String`.
2. Similar to the serializer, it aggregates all model names from the predefined enums into a single list.
3. It attempts to find a matching entry by comparing the key (model name) with the input string.
4. If a match is found, it returns the corresponding `OpenAITextModel` instance. If no match is found, it constructs a
   new `OpenAITextModel` instance using the input model name.

### Usage

To use these custom serializer and deserializer classes, the `OpenAITextModel` class is annotated
with `@JsonDeserialize` and `@JsonSerialize`, specifying the respective classes to handle serialization and
deserialization. This setup is necessary for integrating with Jackson's data-binding functionality, allowing for
seamless conversion between JSON and `OpenAITextModel` objects in applications that process OpenAI text models.

### Conclusion

The `OpenAITextModel` along with its serializer and deserializer classes provide a robust mechanism for handling JSON
data conversion in applications that utilize OpenAI's text models. By customizing the serialization and deserialization
processes, developers can ensure that model data is accurately and efficiently processed.

# opt\DistanceType.kt

## DistanceType Enum Documentation

The `DistanceType` enum, defined in the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.opt` package, provides a way to calculate the distance
between two vectors, specifically between content and prompt embeddings. This can be useful in various applications,
such as similarity measurement, optimization tasks, or machine learning algorithms where understanding the distance or
dissimilarity between data points is crucial.

### Enum Values

The `DistanceType` enum consists of three distinct types of distance calculations:

- `Euclidean`
- `Manhattan`
- `Cosine`

Each type implements a specific strategy for calculating the distance between two double arrays, representing the
content and prompt embeddings.

#### Euclidean

Calculates the Euclidean distance between two vectors. This is the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points
in Euclidean space.

**Method Signature:**

```kotlin
fun distance(contentEmbedding: DoubleArray, promptEmbedding: DoubleArray): Double
```

**Parameters:**

- `contentEmbedding`: The first vector as a `DoubleArray`.
- `promptEmbedding`: The second vector as a `DoubleArray`.

**Returns:** The Euclidean distance as a `Double`.

#### Manhattan

Calculates the Manhattan (or taxicab) distance between two vectors. This is the sum of the absolute differences of their
coordinates.

**Method Signature:**

```kotlin
fun distance(contentEmbedding: DoubleArray, promptEmbedding: DoubleArray): Double
```

**Parameters:**

- `contentEmbedding`: The first vector as a `DoubleArray`.
- `promptEmbedding`: The second vector as a `DoubleArray`.

**Returns:** The Manhattan distance as a `Double`.

#### Cosine

Calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors and returns the cosine distance by subtracting the cosine
similarity from 1. This measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing insight into their directional
difference regardless of their magnitude.

**Method Signature:**

```kotlin
fun distance(contentEmbedding: DoubleArray, promptEmbedding: DoubleArray): Double
```

**Parameters:**

- `contentEmbedding`: The first vector as a `DoubleArray`.
- `promptEmbedding`: The second vector as a `DoubleArray`.

**Returns:** The cosine distance as a `Double`.

### Usage Example

To use the `DistanceType` enum for calculating distances, you can do the following:

```kotlin
val contentEmbedding = doubleArrayOf(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
val promptEmbedding = doubleArrayOf(4.0, 5.0, 6.0)

val euclideanDistance = DistanceType.Euclidean.distance(contentEmbedding, promptEmbedding)
println("Euclidean Distance: $euclideanDistance")

val manhattanDistance = DistanceType.Manhattan.distance(contentEmbedding, promptEmbedding)
println("Manhattan Distance: $manhattanDistance")

val cosineDistance = DistanceType.Cosine.distance(contentEmbedding, promptEmbedding)
println("Cosine Distance: $cosineDistance")
```

### Conclusion

The `DistanceType` enum provides a flexible and easy-to-use mechanism for calculating different types of distances
between vectors. By encapsulating the distance calculation logic within enum constants, it allows for clean, readable,
and maintainable code when working with distance measurements in Kotlin.

responses from the OpenAI API in terms of matching specific criteria or patterns. This module is designed to be extended
and customized according to the specific needs of the application. It includes two main subclasses: `VectorMatch`
and `ContainsMatch`, each implementing different strategies for matching and scoring responses.

### Overview

- **Package Name**: `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.opt`
- **Dependencies**: Requires the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai` package for interacting with the OpenAI API, specifically
  using `ApiModel`, `ChatResponse`, and `OpenAIClient`.

### Core Classes

#### `Expectation`

An abstract class that serves as the base for different types of expectation implementations. It defines the structure
for matching and scoring mechanisms against the OpenAI API responses.

##### Abstract Methods

- `matches(api: OpenAIClient, response: ChatResponse): Boolean`: Determines whether a given response matches the
  expectation.
- `score(api: OpenAIClient, response: ChatResponse): Double`: Calculates a score indicating how well the response
  matches the expectation.

#### `VectorMatch`

A subclass of `Expectation` that evaluates responses based on the semantic similarity between the response content and a
predefined example text. It utilizes embeddings to compute the distance (similarity) between texts.

##### Parameters

- `example`: The example text to compare against the response.
- `metric`: The distance metric to use for comparison. Defaults to `DistanceType.Cosine`.

##### Key Methods

- `score(api: OpenAIClient, response: ChatResponse)`: Computes the negative distance between the embeddings of the
  example text and the response content as the score.

#### `ContainsMatch`

A subclass of `Expectation` focused on pattern matching within the response content. It uses regular expressions to
identify if the response contains certain patterns.

##### Parameters

- `pattern`: A `Regex` pattern that the response content is expected to match.
- `critical`: A boolean flag indicating if the pattern match is critical for the response to be considered valid.
  Defaults to `true`.

##### Key Methods

- `matches(api: OpenAIClient, response: ChatResponse)`: Checks if the response content matches the provided regex
  pattern.
- `score(api: OpenAIClient, response: ChatResponse)`: Returns a score of `1.0` if the pattern matches, otherwise `0.0`.

### Usage

To use the `Expectation` module, developers need to create instances of either `VectorMatch` or `ContainsMatch` (or
custom subclasses), providing the necessary parameters. These instances can then be used to evaluate responses from the
OpenAI API by calling the `matches` and `score` methods, passing an `OpenAIClient` instance and a `ChatResponse` object.

#### Example

```kotlin
val apiClient = OpenAIClient("your_api_key")
val response = apiClient.chat("Your prompt here")

val expectation = VectorMatch("Expected response content")
if (expectation.matches(apiClient, response)) {
    val score = expectation.score(apiClient, response)
    println("Match Score: $score")
}
```

### Logging

The module utilizes SLF4J for logging information, such as distance calculations in `VectorMatch` and pattern match
failures in `ContainsMatch`.

### Conclusion

The `Expectation` module provides a flexible and extensible way to evaluate and score responses from the OpenAI API,
facilitating the development of applications that require specific response criteria or semantic similarity checks.

# proxy\ValidatedObject.kt

## ValidatedObject Interface Documentation

The `ValidatedObject` interface is designed to provide a structured way to validate objects in Kotlin, particularly for
ensuring that objects meet certain validation criteria before they are processed or persisted. This interface is part of
the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.proxy` package.

### Overview

The `ValidatedObject` interface includes a default method `validate()` that can be overridden by implementing classes to
define custom validation logic. Additionally, it contains a nested `ValidationError` class for representing validation
errors and a companion object with utility methods to facilitate the validation of object fields.

### Usage

To use the `ValidatedObject` interface, a class must implement the interface and, optionally, override the `validate()`
method to provide custom validation logic. If the `validate()` method returns `null`, it indicates that the object is
valid. If it returns a non-null `String`, it indicates a validation error with the provided message.

#### Example

```kotlin
class User(val name: String, val age: Int) : ValidatedObject {
    override fun validate(): String? {
        if (name.isBlank()) return "Name cannot be blank"
        if (age < 0) return "Age cannot be negative"
        return null // Object is valid
    }
}
```

### ValidationError Class

The `ValidationError` class is a custom exception type used to indicate a validation error. It
extends `RuntimeException` and includes additional information about the object that failed validation.

#### Properties

- `message`: The error message.
- `obj`: The object that failed validation.

#### Usage

The `ValidationError` class is typically used within the `validate()` method or other validation logic to throw an
exception when a validation error is encountered.

### Companion Object

The companion object within the `ValidatedObject` interface provides a utility
method `validateFields(obj: Any): String?` for validating the fields of an object.

#### validateFields Method

This method iterates over the declared fields and Kotlin properties of the provided object. It performs validation on
fields and properties that implement the `ValidatedObject` interface or are lists of objects implementing
the `ValidatedObject` interface.

##### Parameters

- `obj`: The object whose fields are to be validated.

##### Returns

- `null` if all fields are valid.
- A `String` containing the validation error message if any field is invalid.

#### Usage

The `validateFields` method is typically used within the `validate()` method of a `ValidatedObject` to validate nested
objects or lists of objects.

### Conclusion

The `ValidatedObject` interface and its associated components provide a flexible and structured way to implement object
validation in Kotlin applications. By implementing this interface, developers can ensure that their objects meet the
required validation criteria before they are used further in the application.

# util\ClientUtil.kt

## ClientUtil Module Documentation

The `ClientUtil` module is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.util` package and provides utility functions and
properties to interact with OpenAI's API, handle errors, and manage API keys. This documentation outlines the
functionalities provided by the `ClientUtil` object.

### Overview

`ClientUtil` includes methods for error checking, API key management, and utility functions for converting strings to
specific model input formats. It also defines patterns to identify specific error messages returned by the OpenAI API.

### Functions and Properties

#### Error Handling

- **`checkError(result: String)`**: Parses the JSON response from the OpenAI API and throws specific exceptions based on
  the error message content. This method identifies various error scenarios such as request overloads, safety system
  rejections, rate limits, quota exceedances, invalid models, and invalid values.

#### API Key Management

- **`keyTxt`**: A property to get or set the API key as a `String`. The getter attempts to retrieve the API key from
  multiple sources in the following order: an in-memory variable, a resource file named `/openai.key.json`, a file in
  the user's home directory, and an environment variable `OPENAI_KEY`.

- **`keyMap`**: A read-only property that returns a mutable map of the API key. It attempts to parse the API key from
  the same sources as `keyTxt` but expects the key to be in JSON format.

#### Utility Functions

- **`String.toContentList()`**: An extension function on `String` that converts the string into a list containing a
  single `ApiModel.ContentPart` with the string as its text content.

- **`String.toChatMessage(role: ApiModel.Role = ApiModel.Role.user)`**: An extension function on `String` that converts
  the string into an `ApiModel.ChatMessage` object, optionally taking a role (defaulting to `user`).

#### Constants and Patterns

- **`allowedCharset`**: Defines the allowed character set as ASCII.

- **`maxTokenErrorMessage`**, **`safetyErrorMessage`**, **`rateLimitErrorMessage`**, **`rateLimitErrorMessage2`**, *
  *`rateLimitErrorMessage3`**, **`quotaErrorMessage`**, **`invalidModelException`**, **`invalidValueException`**:Regular
  expressions to match specific error messages returned by the OpenAI API.

### Exceptions

The module defines or uses several exceptions to signal specific error conditions encountered when interacting with the
OpenAI API:

- `RequestOverloadException`
- `SafetyException`
- `ModelMaxException`
- `RateLimitException`
- `QuotaException`
- `InvalidModelException`
- `InvalidValueException`
- `IOException`

These exceptions are thrown by the `checkError` function when corresponding error conditions are detected in the API
response.

### Usage

To use the `ClientUtil` functionalities, import the module and directly invoke its properties and functions. For
example, to check for errors in an API response:

```kotlin
val apiResponse = "{...}" // JSON response from OpenAI API
try {
    ClientUtil.checkError(apiResponse)
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle specific exceptions
}
```

To set or get the API key:

```kotlin
// Set the API key
ClientUtil.keyTxt = "your_api_key"

// Get the API key
val apiKey = ClientUtil.keyTxt
```

### Conclusion

The `ClientUtil` module provides essential utilities for handling errors, managing API keys, and preparing data for
interaction with the OpenAI API. Its functions and properties simplify the development of applications that use OpenAI's
services by abstracting common tasks and error handling routines.

### Usage

#### Object Mapper Configuration

The `objectMapper()` function returns a pre-configured `ObjectMapper` instance from the Jackson library, set up with
various features enabled or disabled to support flexible and error-tolerant JSON parsing and serialization:

```kotlin
val objectMapper = JsonUtil.objectMapper()
```

#### Serialization to JSON

The `toJson(data: Any): String` function serializes a given Kotlin object to a JSON string, using the
pre-configured `ObjectMapper`:

```kotlin
val jsonString = JsonUtil.toJson(myObject)
```

#### Deserialization from JSON

The `fromJson<T>(data: String, type: Type): T` function deserializes a JSON string to a Kotlin object of the specified
type:

```kotlin
val myObject: MyType = JsonUtil.fromJson(jsonString, MyType::class.java)
```

### Configuration Details

The `ObjectMapper` is configured with the following features:

- **JSON Parser Features**: Allows comments, unquoted field names, and single quotes in JSON.
- **Deserialization Features**: Disables failures on unknown properties, ignored properties, missing creator properties,
  and trailing tokens.

  trailing commas, and more.
- **Serialization Inclusion**: Excludes null values from the serialized JSON.
- **Kotlin Module**: Registers a `KotlinModule` with specific configurations for handling Kotlin classes and features.

### Limitations

- The `fromJson` function has a type check for `String` class to directly return the input data if the expected type is
  a `String`. This might not be suitable for all use cases where the input JSON string represents a complex type that
  coincidentally is expected to be a `String`.
- The `KotlinModule` configurations are set to not convert nulls to empty collections or maps, and strict null checks
  are disabled. These settings might need to be adjusted based on specific application requirements.

### Conclusion

The `JsonUtil` object provides a convenient and flexible way to handle JSON serialization and deserialization in Kotlin
applications, with configurations tailored to support a wide range of JSON formats and features.

methods for manipulating and processing `CharSequence` and `String` objects. These methods facilitate common text
operations such as trimming, prefix/suffix manipulation, line wrapping, character set restriction, and more.

### Methods

#### `stripPrefix(text: CharSequence, prefix: CharSequence): CharSequence`

Removes the specified prefix from the beginning of the given text if present.

- **Parameters:**
    - `text`: The text from which to remove the prefix.
    - `prefix`: The prefix to remove.
- **Returns:** The text with the prefix removed, if it was present; otherwise, the original text.

#### `trimPrefix(text: CharSequence): CharSequence`

Trims the whitespace prefix from the beginning of the given text.

- **Parameters:**
    - `text`: The text to trim.
- **Returns:** The text with the leading whitespace removed.

#### `trimSuffix(text: CharSequence): String`

Trims the whitespace suffix from the end of the given text.

- **Parameters:**
    - `text`: The text to trim.
- **Returns:** The text with the trailing whitespace removed.

#### `stripSuffix(text: CharSequence, suffix: CharSequence): String`

Removes the specified suffix from the end of the given text if present.

- **Parameters:**
    - `text`: The text from which to remove the suffix.
    - `suffix`: The suffix to remove.
- **Returns:** The text with the suffix removed, if it was present; otherwise, the original text.

#### `lineWrapping(description: CharSequence, width: Int): String`

Wraps the given text to a specified width by inserting line breaks.

- **Parameters:**
    - `description`: The text to wrap.
    - `width`: The maximum line width before wrapping.
- **Returns:** The wrapped text.

#### `toString(ints: IntArray): CharSequence`

Converts an array of integers to a `CharSequence` by interpreting each integer as a Unicode character.

- **Parameters:**
    - `ints`: The array of integers to convert.
- **Returns:** The resulting `CharSequence`.

#### `getWhitespacePrefix(vararg lines: CharSequence): CharSequence`

Finds the common leading whitespace across multiple lines of text.

- **Parameters:**
    - `lines`: The lines of text to analyze.
- **Returns:** The common leading whitespace.

#### `getWhitespaceSuffix(vararg lines: CharSequence): String`

Finds the common trailing whitespace across multiple lines of text.

- **Parameters:**
    - `lines`: The lines of text to analyze.
- **Returns:** The common trailing whitespace.

#### `trim(items: List<CharSequence>, max: Int, preserveHead: Boolean): List<CharSequence>`

Randomly trims a list of `CharSequence` items to a specified maximum size, optionally preserving the first item.

- **Parameters:**
    - `items`: The list of items to trim.
    - `max`: The maximum size of the list after trimming.
    - `preserveHead`: Whether to always preserve the first item in the list.
- **Returns:** The trimmed list.

#### `getPrefixForContext(text: String, idealLength: Int, vararg delimiters: CharSequence?): CharSequence`

Finds a prefix of the given text that is close to a specified ideal length, splitting the text at specified delimiters.

- **Parameters:**
    - `text`: The text to analyze.
    - `idealLength`: The ideal length of the prefix.
    - `delimiters`: The delimiters to use for splitting the text.
- **Returns:** The prefix closest to the ideal length.

#### `getSuffixForContext(text: String, idealLength: Int, vararg delimiters: CharSequence?): CharSequence`

Finds a suffix of the given text that is close to a specified ideal length, splitting the text at specified delimiters.

- **Parameters:**
    - `text`: The text to analyze.
    - `idealLength`: The ideal length of the suffix.
    - `delimiters`: The delimiters to use for splitting the text.
- **Returns:** The suffix closest to the ideal length.

#### `restrictCharacterSet(text: String, charset: Charset): String`

Restricts the characters in the given text to those that are encodable in the specified character set.

- **Parameters:**
    - `text`: The text to restrict.
    - `charset`: The `Charset` to use for restriction.
- **Returns:** The text with characters restricted to the specified charset.

### Usage Example

```kotlin
val originalText = "    This is an example text.    "
val trimmedText = StringUtil.trimPrefix(originalText).toString()
println(trimmedText) // Output: "This is an example text.    "
```

This documentation provides an overview of the `StringUtil` class and its utility methods. Each method is designed to
perform specific text manipulation tasks, making it easier to process and format strings in Kotlin and Java
applications.
