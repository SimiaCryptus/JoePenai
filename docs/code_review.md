# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\describe\Description.kt

The provided code snippet defines a custom annotation in Kotlin, named `Description`. This annotation is designed to be
used in Kotlin projects to add descriptive metadata to classes, methods, or fields. Below is a detailed documentation of
this annotation.

#### `Description` Annotation

##### Overview

The `Description` annotation allows developers to attach a textual description to various elements within a Kotlin
codebase. This can be particularly useful for providing context or explanations directly in the code, enhancing
readability and maintainability.

##### Declaration

```kotlin
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.describe

@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Description(val value: String)
```

##### Attributes

- `value`: A `String` parameter that holds the descriptive text. This is the only parameter for the annotation, making
  it straightforward to use by simply providing the descriptive text as an argument.

##### Retention Policy

- The `@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)` annotation specifies that this annotation is available at runtime. This
  means that the annotation can be accessed through reflection at runtime, allowing for dynamic processing or
  documentation generation based on these annotations.

##### Usage Example

```kotlin
@Description("This function calculates the sum of two integers.")
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}
```

In the example above, the `Description` annotation is used to provide a brief explanation of what the `add` function
does. This can help other developers understand the purpose of the function at a glance, without needing to dive into
the implementation details.

##### Use Cases

- **Documentation Generation**: Tools can utilize the `Description` annotations to automatically generate documentation
  for code elements, providing a richer and more informative documentation experience.
- **Code Readability**: By providing contextual descriptions directly in the code, developers can improve the
  readability and maintainability of the codebase.
- **Reflection-Based Logic**: Since the annotation is retained at runtime, it can be used in reflection-based logic to
  dynamically process or handle annotated elements based on their descriptions.

##### Best Practices

- **Conciseness**: Keep the description concise yet informative. Aim to provide enough context to understand the purpose
  of the annotated element without overwhelming details.
- **Consistency**: Adopt a consistent style and level of detail across descriptions within a project to ensure a uniform
  documentation experience.
- **Relevance**: Ensure that the description remains relevant and up-to-date with the code. Outdated descriptions can be

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\exceptions\AIServiceException.kt

#### Documentation for AIServiceException Class

The `AIServiceException` class is a custom exception type defined within the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions`
package. This class extends the `IOException` class from Java's standard library, making it suitable for signaling
issues related to Input/Output operations, particularly those that may occur during interactions with AI services.

##### Code Snippet:

```kotlin
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions

import java.io.IOException

open class AIServiceException(message: String?) : IOException(message)
```

##### Key Components:

- **Package Declaration**: The first line specifies the package in which this class is
  defined, `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions`. Organizing classes into packages helps in managing the codebase,
  especially for larger projects.

- **Imports**: The `import` statement for `java.io.IOException` is included to allow `AIServiceException` to extend
  the `IOException` class. This import is necessary because `IOException` is part of the Java standard library and not
  automatically available in the Kotlin file.

- **Class Declaration**: The `AIServiceException` class is declared as `open`, which means it can be subclassed. This is
  a key feature for exception classes, as it allows developers to create more specific exception types based on this
  class if needed.

- **Constructor and Inheritance**: The class constructor accepts a nullable `String` parameter named `message`, which
  represents the error message associated with the exception. By passing this `message` to the
  superclass (`IOException`) constructor, `AIServiceException` leverages the built-in messaging functionality of
  exceptions in Java.

##### Usage:

The `AIServiceException` class is designed to be thrown when an AI-related service encounters an issue that warrants an
exception, particularly during I/O operations. For example, if an application interacts with an external AI service and
encounters an unexpected response or failure, throwing an `AIServiceException` with a descriptive message can help in
diagnosing the issue.

##### Example:

```kotlin
fun someAIInteractionFunction() {
    try {
        // Code to interact with an AI service
    } catch (e: SomeSpecificException) {
        throw AIServiceException("Failed to process AI service response: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

In this example, if the code block designated for interacting with an AI service throws a `SomeSpecificException`, it is
caught, and an `AIServiceException` is thrown with a message that includes details about the original exception. This
approach helps in encapsulating AI service-related exceptions within a specific exception type, making them easier to
handle and debug.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\describe\YamlDescriber.kt

#### Documentation for `YamlDescriber` Class

##### Overview

The `YamlDescriber` class, part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.describe` package, is designed to generate YAML
descriptions of Java and Kotlin classes. This functionality is particularly useful for documenting APIs, data models, or
any complex object structures in a human-readable format. The class extends `TypeDescriber`, leveraging reflection and
annotations to introspect classes and their members.

##### Key Features

- **Markup Language Support:** Generates descriptions in YAML format.
- **Recursion Prevention:** Avoids infinite loops when encountering recursive type references.
- **Visibility Filtering:** Considers only public properties and methods for description.
- **Annotation Support:** Utilizes custom annotations like `Description` to provide additional information in the
  output.
- **Method Inclusion:** Optionally includes public methods in the description, with the ability to blacklist common
  methods like `equals`, `hashCode`, etc.
- **Type Handling:** Supports a wide range of types including primitives, enums, arrays, collections, and maps.

##### Usage

To use the `YamlDescriber`, instantiate the class and call the `describe` method with the class you wish to describe,
along with any necessary parameters such as `stackMax` for controlling recursion depth and `describedTypes` to track
already described types.

Example:

```kotlin
val describer = YamlDescriber()
val yamlDescription = describer.describe(MyClass::class.java, stackMax = 5, describedTypes = mutableSetOf())
println(yamlDescription)
```

##### Methods Overview

- `describe(rawType: Class<in Nothing>, stackMax: Int, describedTypes: MutableSet<String>): String`:
  Generates a YAML description of the specified class. Handles recursion, type filtering, and annotation processing.

- `describe(self: Method, clazz: Class<*>?, stackMax: Int): String`:
  Overloaded method to describe Java `Method` objects, including parameter and return type descriptions.

- `describe(self: KFunction<*>, concreteClass: KClass<*>, stackMax: Int, includeOperationID: Boolean, describedTypes: MutableSet<String>): String`:
  Describes Kotlin functions, supporting optional operation IDs and handling recursive type references.

##### Customization

- **Include Methods:** By default, public methods are included in the description. This behavior can be toggled by
  setting the `includeMethods` property.
- **Method Blacklist:** Customize the `methodBlacklist` set to exclude specific methods from the description.
- **Cover Methods:** Control whether method descriptions are included in the output through the `coverMethods` property.

##### Annotations

- `@Description`: Can be applied to fields, methods, or parameters to include descriptive text in the YAML output.

##### Limitations

- The describer may not fully capture the nuances of complex generic types or deeply nested structures within
  the `stackMax` limit.
- Custom handling may be required for types not directly supported or for special serialization needs.

##### Conclusion

The `YamlDescriber` class offers a flexible and powerful tool for generating detailed YAML descriptions of Java and
Kotlin classes. By leveraging reflection and custom annotations, it provides a means to document complex data models and
APIs in a format that is both human-readable and machine-processable.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\exceptions\InvalidModelException.kt

#### Documentation for `InvalidModelException` Class

##### Overview

The `InvalidModelException` class is a custom exception defined within the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions`
package. It extends the `AIServiceException`, indicating that it is specifically used to signal issues related to AI
services, particularly when an invalid model is encountered.

##### Constructor

```kotlin
InvalidModelException(model: String?)
```

- **Parameters:**
    - `model: String?` - An optional string parameter that represents the model which caused the exception. This
      parameter can be `null`.

##### Usage

The `InvalidModelException` is thrown when an operation involving AI models fails due to the model being invalid. This
could occur in scenarios where the model identifier does not match any known models, the model is not properly
configured, or the model data is corrupted.

##### Example

```kotlin
if (!isValidModel(modelId)) {
    throw InvalidModelException(modelId)
}
```

In the above example, `isValidModel` is a hypothetical function that checks if the provided `modelId` corresponds to a
valid model. If the model is not valid, an `InvalidModelException` is thrown, including the `modelId` in the exception
message to aid in debugging.

##### Key Features

- **Specificity:** By extending `AIServiceException`, it clearly categorizes itself under AI service-related exceptions,
  making it easier for developers to catch and handle AI-specific issues.
- **Informative:** It conveys specific information about the nature of the error (i.e., invalid model) and optionally
  includes the model identifier, aiding in troubleshooting.

##### Best Practices

- **Exception Handling:** When using functions or methods that can throw an `InvalidModelException`, ensure to catch
  this exception explicitly to handle invalid model scenarios gracefully.
- **Logging:** Consider logging the exception details, especially the model identifier, to facilitate debugging and
  tracking of issues related to invalid models.
- **Validation:** To minimize the occurrences of this exception, validate model identifiers or configurations before
  using them in operations that could throw an `InvalidModelException`.

This class is a part of the broader exception handling mechanism within AI services, designed to provide clear and
actionable feedback when operations fail due to model-related issues.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\exceptions\InvalidValueException.kt

#### Documentation for `InvalidValueException` Class

The `InvalidValueException` class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions` package and extends
the `AIServiceException`. This custom exception is designed to be thrown when an invalid value is encountered within the
application, specifically in the context of interacting with AI services.

##### Class Definition

```kotlin
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions

class InvalidValueException(field: String?, value: String?) : 
    AIServiceException("Invalid value: $field = $value")
```

##### Parameters:

- `field`: A `String?` (nullable String) representing the name of the field that received the invalid value. This
  parameter helps in identifying which part of the data or request was problematic.
- `value`: A `String?` (nullable String) indicating the invalid value that was assigned or passed to the field. This
  provides clarity on what value caused the exception to be thrown.

##### Usage:

The `InvalidValueException` is thrown when the application detects an invalid value for a given field during its
operation, especially in scenarios involving AI service interactions. This could be due to data validation failures,
incorrect data types, or values that are out of the expected range.

##### Example:

Consider a scenario where an AI service expects a numerical value for a parameter named `age`, but receives a string
instead. The `InvalidValueException` can be thrown to signal this discrepancy:

```kotlin
if (ageValue is String) {
    throw InvalidValueException("age", ageValue)
}
```

This exception clearly communicates the issue, specifying that the `age` field received an invalid value, which in this
case, is of an incorrect type.

##### Conclusion:

The `InvalidValueException` serves as a specific type of exception that aids in debugging and error handling by
providing detailed information about invalid values encountered in the application. By including the field name and the
invalid value in the exception message, it allows developers to quickly identify and address the root cause of the
issue.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\exceptions\ModerationException.kt

#### Documentation for `ModerationException` Class

The `ModerationException` class is a custom exception defined in the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions` package. This
class extends the standard Java `Exception` class, allowing it to be used in situations where specific handling for
moderation-related errors is required. Below is a detailed explanation of the class and its usage.

##### Class Definition

```kotlin
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions

class ModerationException(message: String?) : Exception(message)
```

##### Purpose

The `ModerationException` class is designed to represent errors or exceptional situations that arise specifically in the
context of moderation processes. This could include, but is not limited to, violations of content policies, attempts to
post restricted content, or other scenarios where moderation rules prevent an action from being completed.

##### Usage

To use the `ModerationException`, you would typically throw it within a method that encounters a moderation-related
issue. Here is a simple example:

```kotlin
fun checkContent(content: String) {
    if (content.contains("restricted term")) {
        throw ModerationException("Content violates moderation policy due to the presence of restricted terms.")
    }
    // Proceed with content processing
}
```

In this example, the `checkContent` function checks if the provided content string contains any terms that are not
allowed. If such a term is found, the function throws a `ModerationException` with a message explaining the reason for
the exception.

##### Handling `ModerationException`

When a `ModerationException` is thrown, it can be caught and handled like any other exception in Kotlin. This allows for
graceful handling of moderation-related errors, such as logging the issue, notifying the user, or taking corrective
action. Here is an example of catching and handling a `ModerationException`:

```kotlin
try {
    checkContent(userInput)
} catch (e: ModerationException) {
    println("Error: ${e.message}")
    // Handle the moderation exception, e.g., by informing the user
}
```

##### Conclusion

The `ModerationException` class provides a clear and specific way to signal errors related to moderation within an
application. By extending the standard `Exception` class, it integrates seamlessly with Kotlin's exception handling
mechanisms, making it easy to use and handle. This custom exception is particularly useful in applications where content
moderation is a key concern, allowing developers to clearly distinguish moderation issues from other types of errors.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\exceptions\QuotaException.kt

#### Documentation for `QuotaException` Class

The `QuotaException` class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions` package and extends
the `AIServiceException`. This class is specifically designed to represent exceptions that occur when a quota limit is
exceeded during the operation of AI services. Below is a detailed explanation of the class and its usage.

##### Class Definition

```kotlin
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions

class QuotaException : AIServiceException("Quota exceeded")
```

##### Purpose

The `QuotaException` class serves as a specialized exception that indicates a quota limit has been surpassed. Quota
limits are typically set to prevent overuse of resources in software applications, especially those that interact with
external services or APIs. When an operation exceeds the allowed quota, this exception is thrown to signal the specific
nature of the error, allowing for more precise error handling and user feedback.

##### Usage

This exception should be thrown in scenarios where an application's operation exceeds the predefined quota limits set by
an AI service or a similar resource-restricted service. It is a direct subclass of `AIServiceException`, which means it
inherits all the properties and behaviors of its parent, with the added specificity of being related to quota issues.

Example usage might look like this:

```kotlin
fun performAIRequest() {
    if (hasExceededQuota()) {
        throw QuotaException()
    }
    // Proceed with the request
}

fun hasExceededQuota(): Boolean {
    // Logic to determine if the quota has been exceeded
    return true // Placeholder return value
}
```

In this example, `performAIRequest` is a function that checks if the quota has been exceeded before proceeding with its
operation. If the quota is exceeded, it throws a `QuotaException`, signaling to the calling code that the operation
cannot proceed due to quota restrictions.

##### Handling `QuotaException`

When catching and handling `QuotaException`, it's important to provide clear feedback to the user or the calling system
about the nature of the error. Since this exception indicates that a limit has been reached, the response might include
instructions on how to increase the quota or reduce usage.

Example handling might look like this:

```kotlin
try {
    performAIRequest()
} catch (e: QuotaException) {
    // Inform the user or take corrective action
    println("Quota limit exceeded. Please try again later or contact support to increase your quota.")
}
```

##### Conclusion

The `QuotaException` class is a crucial component for managing and signaling quota-related errors in applications that
interact with AI services or other resource-restricted services. By specifically identifying quota exceedances, it
allows for more granular error handling and improves the user experience by providing clear and actionable feedback when
limits are reached.

  or operation. This is essentially the cooldown period that needs to be observed to comply with the rate limit policy
  and avoid further exceptions.

##### Exception Message

The exception message constructed by `RateLimitException` provides a concise summary of the rate limit issue
encountered. It includes the organization or service identifier (`org`), the rate limit value (`limit`), and the
recommended delay (`delay`). This message is intended to inform the developer or the user about the specifics of the
rate limit violation, facilitating appropriate handling or adjustments in the request strategy.

##### Usage Scenario

`RateLimitException` is typically thrown when an application makes requests to an AI service at a rate exceeding the
service's allowed limits. Catching this exception allows developers to implement logic for handling rate limit
violations gracefully, such as by introducing delays, reducing request frequency, or notifying the user about the issue.

##### Example

```kotlin
try {
    // Code that makes requests to an AI service
} catch (e: RateLimitException) {
    println("Rate limit exceeded. Please wait ${e.delay} milliseconds before retrying.")
    // Logic to handle the exception, e.g., implementing a delay
}
```

This class plays a crucial role in managing and maintaining the stability and reliability of applications that interact
with rate-limited AI services, ensuring that they adhere to the service's usage policies.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\exceptions\SafetyException.kt

#### Documentation for `SafetyException` Class

The `SafetyException` class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions` package and extends
the `AIServiceException`. This class represents a specific type of exception that is thrown when a safety violation
occurs within the application, particularly in the context of AI services.

##### Code Snippet:

```kotlin
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions

class SafetyException : AIServiceException("Safety violation")
```

do not meet the safety criteria set by the application.

##### Example:

```kotlin
fun checkContentSafety(content: String) {
    if (!isContentSafe(content)) {
        throw SafetyException()
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `checkContentSafety` function checks whether the provided content meets safety standards
through the `isContentSafe` function. If the content is deemed unsafe, a `SafetyException` is thrown, indicating a
safety violation.

##### Conclusion:

The `SafetyException` class is a crucial part of handling safety-related issues within AI services, ensuring that any
operation or data that does not comply with safety standards is promptly identified and managed through exception
handling. This aids in maintaining the integrity and safety of the application and its users.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\exceptions\RequestOverloadException.kt

#### Documentation for `RequestOverloadException` Class

The `RequestOverloadException` class is a custom exception defined in the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions` package.
It extends the `IOException` class from Java's standard library, making it a checked exception that signals an issue
with I/O operations. This specific exception is tailored to indicate situations where a model is currently overloaded
with requests.

##### Code Structure

```kotlin
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions

import java.io.IOException

class RequestOverloadException(message: String = "That model is currently overloaded with other requests.") :
    IOException(message)
```

##### Key Components:

- **Package Declaration**: `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions`
    - This line specifies the package in which the `RequestOverloadException` class is defined. Organizing classes into
      packages helps in managing the codebase of larger projects.

- **Imports**:
    - `import java.io.IOException`
        - This line imports the `IOException` class from Java's standard library, which `RequestOverloadException`
          extends.

- **Class Declaration**: `RequestOverloadException`
    - The class is declared with a single constructor parameter, `message`, which is a `String`. This parameter is used
      to provide a custom message when the exception is thrown. The default message is "That model is currently
      overloaded with other requests."

- **Inheritance**:
    - By extending `IOException`, `RequestOverloadException` inherits all the characteristics of an I/O exception. This
      makes it suitable for signaling issues related to I/O operations, in this case, indicating that a model is
      overloaded.

##### Usage Example:

```kotlin
throw RequestOverloadException("Custom overload message")
```

In this example, a new instance of `RequestOverloadException` is thrown with a custom message. This can be used in
scenarios where an application interacts with models (e.g., machine learning models) and needs to signal that the model
cannot currently process any more requests due to overload.

##### Best Practices:

- **Exception Handling**: Since `RequestOverloadException` is a checked exception, it must be either caught or declared
  in the method signature where it might be thrown. This encourages proactive handling of overload scenarios.
- **Custom Messages**: While a default message is provided, it's a good practice to use custom messages that provide
  more context about the overload situation, making debugging and logging more informative.
- **Documentation**: Documenting the scenarios in which this exception might be thrown helps maintainers and users of
  your code understand its behavior better.

This class is a straightforward yet effective way to signal specific I/O-related issues, promoting clearer error
handling and communication in applications that interact with potentially overloaded systems or models.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\models\OpenAIModel.kt

#### Documentation for `OpenAIModel` Interface

##### Overview

The `OpenAIModel` interface is part of the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.models` package, designed to serve as a
foundational component for models interacting with OpenAI's API or related functionalities. This interface is crucial
for ensuring a standardized approach to defining models within the application, facilitating easier management, and
enhancing the scalability of the codebase.

##### Interface Definition

```kotlin
package com.simiacryptus.jopenai.models

interface OpenAIModel {
    val modelName: String
}
```

##### Key Components

- **Package Name:** `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.models`
    - This package contains model definitions and interfaces related to OpenAI functionalities.

- **Interface Name:** `OpenAIModel`
    - A simple yet essential interface that outlines the structure for OpenAI models within the application.

- **Property:**
    - `val modelName: String`
        - A read-only property that should return the name of the model. This property is crucial for identifying the
          model instance and could be used for logging, analytics, or conditional logic based on the model name.

##### Usage

Implementing the `OpenAIModel` interface allows for a consistent and standardized way to define models that interact

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\proxy\ValidatedObject.kt

#### Documentation for `ValidatedObject` Interface and Companion Object

The `ValidatedObject` interface and its companion object in the `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.proxy` package provide a
mechanism for validating Kotlin objects, ensuring they meet certain criteria before being processed or persisted. This
documentation outlines the purpose, usage, and key components of the validation system.

##### Purpose

The primary goal of the `ValidatedObject` interface is to offer a standardized way to validate objects within the
system. It allows for implementing custom validation logic on a per-object basis and automatically handles common
validation scenarios, such as validating nested objects and lists of validated objects.

##### Usage

To use the validation system, an object must implement the `ValidatedObject` interface. This requires the implementation
of the `validate` method, which should return a `String?`. A `null` return value indicates that the object is valid,
while a non-null return value should contain a message describing the validation failure.

```kotlin
class MyObject : ValidatedObject {
    var property: String? = null

    override fun validate(): String? {
        if (property.isNullOrEmpty()) {
            return "Property must not be null or empty"
        }
        return null
    }
}
```

##### Key Components

- **`validate` Method**: The primary method that needs to be overridden by implementing classes. It should return `null`
  if the object is valid or a string message if not.

- **`ValidationError` Class**: A custom exception type used to indicate a validation error. It includes both the error
  message and the invalid object itself, serialized to JSON for easier debugging.

- **`validateFields` Method**: A helper method within the companion object that automatically validates all fields of an
  object. It checks if each field is an instance of `ValidatedObject` and calls its `validate` method. It also supports
  lists of `ValidatedObject` instances, validating each element in the list.

##### Validation Process

The validation process is initiated by calling the `validate` method on an object that implements the `ValidatedObject`
interface. If the object contains nested `ValidatedObject` instances or lists of them, the `validateFields` method in
the companion object recursively validates each of these nested objects.

If any validation fails, the `validate` method should return a descriptive error message. In cases where automatic field
validation is used, the process stops at the first encountered validation error and returns its message.

##### Example

```kotlin
class User : ValidatedObject {
    var name: String? = null
    var age: Int? = null

    override fun validate(): String? {
        if (name.isNullOrEmpty()) {
            return "Name must not be null or empty"
        }
        if (age == null || age!! < 0) {
            return "Age must be a positive number"
        }
        return null
    }
}
```

In this example, a `User` object is considered valid if it has a non-null, non-empty name and a non-null, positive age.
The `validate` method checks these conditions and returns appropriate error messages if they are not met.

##### Conclusion

The `ValidatedObject` interface and its companion object provide a flexible and powerful system for object validation in
Kotlin. By implementing custom validation logic and leveraging automatic field validation, developers can ensure their
objects are in a valid state before proceeding with further processing.
