# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\exceptions\InvalidModelException.kt

To test the `InvalidModelException` class, you can create a test case using a testing framework like JUnit. Below is an
example of how you can write a test case to verify the functionality of the `InvalidModelException` class:

```java
import com.simiacryptus.jopenai.exceptions.InvalidModelException;
import org.junit.Test;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class InvalidModelExceptionTest {

    @Test
    public void testInvalidModelException() {
        String modelName = "testModel";
        InvalidModelException exception = new InvalidModelException(modelName);

        assertEquals("Invalid model: " + modelName, exception.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this test case:

1. We import the necessary classes including `InvalidModelException` and `JUnit` assertions.
2. We create a test method `testInvalidModelException` annotated with `@Test`.
3. Inside the test method, we provide a model name "testModel" and create an instance of `InvalidModelException` with
   this model name.
4. We then use `assertEquals` to verify that the exception message generated by the `InvalidModelException` constructor
   matches the expected message "Invalid model: testModel".

You can run this test case using a testing framework like JUnit to ensure that the `InvalidModelException` class behaves
as expected when instantiated with a model name.

        // Ensure that the proxy behaves as expected when calling methods on the proxied class
    }

    @Test
    public void testCompleteMethodWithExamples() {
        // Create an instance of GPTProxyBase and test the complete method with provided examples
        // Ensure that the method returns the expected output based on the examples provided
    }

    // Add more integration tests for other scenarios as needed
}
```

3. **Load Testing**: If the `complete` method involves making external API calls or heavy computations, consider
   performing load testing to evaluate the performance and scalability of the class under different load conditions.

   unexpected situations and provides meaningful error messages.

6. **Documentation Testing**: Verify that the documentation for the class is clear, accurate, and up-to-date. Ensure
   that code examples and explanations are helpful for users.

By following these steps and creating a comprehensive test plan, you can ensure the reliability and functionality of
the `GPTProxyBase` class.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\util\ClientUtil.kt

To design a test plan for the `ClientUtil` object in the provided Kotlin code, you can follow these steps:

1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests to ensure that each function in the `ClientUtil` object behaves as expected. You
   can use a testing framework like JUnit to create test cases.

2. **Error Handling Testing**: Test the `checkError` function by providing different error messages as input and
   verifying that the correct exceptions are thrown based on the error message content.

3. **Key Retrieval Testing**: Test the `keyTxt` and `keyMap` properties by setting different values for the API key and
   checking if the key is retrieved correctly from various possible sources (file, environment variable, etc.).

4. **Content Conversion Testing**: Test the `toContentList` and `toChatMessage` extension functions by converting
   strings to content lists and chat messages, respectively, and verifying the output.

5. **Pattern Matching Testing**: Test the pattern matching for different error messages defined in the `ClientUtil`
   object to ensure that the patterns correctly identify and extract relevant information from the error messages.

6. **Charset Testing**: Verify that the `allowedCharset` property is correctly set to the ASCII charset and test if it
   behaves as expected when used in the code.

7. **Resource Loading Testing**: Test the resource loading logic in the `keyTxt` property by providing different
   scenarios (file exists, resource not found, environment variable set, etc.) and checking if the key is loaded
   correctly.

8. **JSON Parsing Testing**: Test the JSON parsing logic in the `keyMap` property by providing valid and invalid JSON
   data and verifying that the JSON is parsed correctly into a map.

By following these steps and creating test cases for each aspect of the `ClientUtil` object, you can ensure that the
code functions correctly and handles different scenarios appropriately.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\util\StringUtil.kt

To design a test plan for the `StringUtil` class in the provided code, you can follow these steps:

1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for each public method in the `StringUtil` class to ensure that they work as
   expected.

2. **Test Cases**: Create test cases that cover different scenarios for each method, including edge cases and typical
   use cases.

3. **Test Data**: Prepare test data that includes various types of input strings to validate the behavior of the
   methods.

4. **Test Execution**: Execute the unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit to verify the correctness of the
   methods.

5. **Assertions**: Use assertions to check the expected output against the actual output of each method.

6. **Exception Handling**: Test the methods with invalid input to ensure that they handle exceptions gracefully.

7. **Performance Testing**: If applicable, test the performance of methods that involve string manipulation to ensure
   they are efficient.

8. **Code Coverage**: Measure the code coverage of the unit tests to ensure that all parts of the `StringUtil` class are
   tested.

9. **Documentation**: Document the test plan, including the test cases, expected results, and any issues encountered
   during testing.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive test plan to validate the functionality and reliability of
the `StringUtil` class in the provided code.

# com\simiacryptus\jopenai\util\JsonUtil.kt

To design a test plan for the provided `JsonUtil` class, you can follow these steps:

1. **Unit Testing**:
    - Write unit tests to cover each method in the `JsonUtil` class.
    - Test the `objectMapper()` method to ensure it returns a properly configured `ObjectMapper` instance.
    - Test the `toJson(data: Any)` method to verify that it correctly converts an object to a JSON string.
    - Test the `fromJson(data: String, type: Type)` method to check if it can deserialize a JSON string back to the
      original object.

2. **Test Cases**:
    - Test with different types of input data, including valid and invalid JSON strings.
    - Test with various data types to ensure proper serialization and deserialization.
    - Test edge cases such as empty input, null values, and large data sets.

3. **Exception Handling**:
    - Test how the class handles exceptions, such as invalid JSON format or unsupported data types.
    - Ensure that appropriate error messages or exceptions are thrown when needed.

4. **Performance Testing**:
    - Evaluate the performance of serialization and deserialization operations for large data sets.
    - Measure the time taken for these operations and ensure they meet performance requirements.

5. **Integration Testing**:
    - Integrate the `JsonUtil` class with other components that use JSON serialization/deserialization.
    - Test the interaction between `JsonUtil` and other classes to ensure seamless data exchange.

6. **Code Coverage**:
    - Use code coverage tools to ensure that all lines of code in the `JsonUtil` class are tested.
    - Aim for high code coverage to minimize the risk of undiscovered bugs.

7. **Documentation Testing**:
    - Verify that the documentation for the `JsonUtil` class is accurate and up-to-date.
    - Ensure that the code examples provided in the documentation work as expected.

8. **Regression Testing**:
    - Perform regression testing whenever changes are made to the `JsonUtil` class to ensure existing functionality is
      not affected.

9. **Security Testing**:
    - Check for any security vulnerabilities related to JSON parsing and serialization.
    - Ensure that the class does not expose sensitive information during serialization/deserialization.

10. **Usability Testing**:

- Evaluate the usability of the `JsonUtil` class by testing its ease of use and readability of the code.
- Gather feedback from developers who use the class to identify any usability issues.

By following these steps and designing a comprehensive test plan, you can ensure the reliability, performance, and
security of the `JsonUtil` class in your application.
