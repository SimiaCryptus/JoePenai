# Audio Processing and Transcription System Documentation

## Overview
This audio processing system is a sophisticated, machine learning-powered speech recognition and silence detection framework designed to capture, analyze, and transcribe audio with advanced signal processing techniques.

## Key Components

### 1. AudioPacket
A core data structure representing a segment of audio with multiple computational properties:

#### Features
- Stores audio samples as a float array
- Calculates various audio metrics:
    - Root Mean Square (RMS)
    - Spectral Entropy
    - Spectral Centroid
    - Spectral Flatness
    - A-Weighting (IEC 61672 standard)
    - Zero Crossings

#### Signal Processing Methods
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis
- Audio format conversion (raw bytes, WAV)
- Spectral analysis techniques

### 2. TrainedSilenceDiscriminator
An intelligent silence detection algorithm that learns to distinguish between speech and background noise:

#### Key Capabilities
- Machine learning-based silence detection
- Adaptive thresholding
- Multi-metric audio analysis
- Training modes for silence and speech

#### Metrics Used
- RMS (Root Mean Square)
- A-Weighting
- Spectral Entropy
- Spectral Centroid
- Spectral Flatness

### 3. TranscriptionProcessor
Handles the transcription of audio segments using an AI client:

#### Workflow
1. Receives audio packets from buffer
2. Converts audio to WAV format
3. Sends to transcription service
4. Updates prompt context
5. Triggers callback with transcription result

### 4. DictationManager
Orchestrates the entire audio recording and transcription process:

#### Features
- Microphone line selection
- Audio format configuration
- Recording start/stop management
- Background processing threads
- Error handling

## Advanced Signal Processing Techniques

### Spectral Analysis
- Calculates spectral entropy to measure audio complexity
- Computes spectral centroid to determine audio frequency characteristics
- Applies A-weighting for human hearing perception simulation

### Silence Detection
- Uses probabilistic methods to distinguish speech from noise
- Adaptive thresholding based on statistical distribution of audio metrics
- Supports training and dynamic adjustment

### Entropy-based Thresholding
Implements multiple entropy calculation methods:
- Shannon Entropy
- Gini Impurity
- Jensen-Shannon Divergence
- Bhattacharyya Distance

## Usage Example

```kotlin
val dictationManager = DictationManager().apply {
    // Optional: Select specific microphone
    selectedMicLine = "Built-in Microphone"

    // Configure transcription callback
    onTranscriptionUpdate = { result ->
        println("Transcribed: ${result.text}")
    }
}

// Start recording
dictationManager.startRecording()

// Stop recording when done
dictationManager.stopRecording()
```

## Performance Considerations
